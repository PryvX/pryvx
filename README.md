# PryvX

PryvX is a collection of privacy-enhancing technologies, starting with Private Set Intersection (PSI) and Paillier Homomorphic Encryption (PHE). Our goal is to develop modules or features including PSI, Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and more.

## Modules

### [Private Set Intersection (PSI)](psi/README.md)
Private Set Intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their private sets without revealing any additional information.

For detailed information, see the [PSI README](psi/README.md).

### [Paillier Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)](phe/README.md)
Paillier Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) is a public-key cryptosystem with homomorphic properties, enabling operations on encrypted data without decryption.

For detailed information, see the [PHE README](phe/README.md).

## Installation

You can install the `pryvx` package via pip:

```sh
pip install pryvx
